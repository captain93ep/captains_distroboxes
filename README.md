# Custom Distrobox setup

Various distrobox setup scripts, to quickly reproduce containers.
Using bash directly is the most flexible and customizable way.

Each distrobox gets its own home directory, to not pollute the users main home directory.
In any subdirectory of "setup", call "create_[boxname].sh", to start the setup.
